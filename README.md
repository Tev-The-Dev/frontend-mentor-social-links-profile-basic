### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

A lot of what I learned during this project was code organization. On one of my last frontend mentor projects, my style-sheet wasn't as organized as it could have been. I was just throwing things at the screen and seeing what happened, but this time I was more deliberate with what I wrote. I took note from one of my fellow coders and started by adding variables at the beginning to be used throughout the project, this way, if I change that one variables value, it will reflect in all other areas where I used that variable instead of trying to eye-ball and match the values. I also did a top-down organization strategy. Starting with the main body container, designing that properly, then going section-by section until I felt confident that I had completed the section to satisfaction. Overall, I think I did really well on this project from start to finish and I will be continuing with this strategy as it helped so much when something didn't look right, or line up as I thought it should have.

I also re-learned how to do media queries for responsive designs. This was something I wasn't familiar with, even though I learned it in my class, but I only got the one practice with them. This project brought that back to me and although mine may not be 100% perfect for scaling, it is a good start I think.

This is how I made those variables in the stylesheet:
:root {
    --Green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Grey700: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --Grey800: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --Grey900: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
    --Paragraph: 14px;
    --font_family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    --font_weight400: 400;
    --font_weight600: 600;
    --font_weight700: 700;
}


### Continued development

An area that I want to be more confident in is using flexboxes. I started playing flex-box zombies a couple weeks ago then got inspired to start frontend mentor. I struggled with flex-basic and the last 4 levels of the game so this is something that I want to understand better.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - This helped me understand how to organize content on a page. This is a great and fun tool to organize content, whether it needs to be centered, right/left aligned or make the page cleaner.
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft) - This is an amazing tool to help check for errors, especially since I used basic text editor insted of something like Visual Studio Code. It is also a great tool to ask the syntax of a particular tag, for example, if I needed to remember the syntax of the <img> tag. Should i use src or href to get the image data to link.

## Acknowledgments

I took great inspiration and was inspired to organize my files from Tiouk Amine (@aminetiouk)https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/aminetiouk 

His designs are very accurate and noteworthy and I was able to learn and understand much just by studying his code. I know I've already said it to you, but if you're reading this Tiouke, Thank you for being awesome!
